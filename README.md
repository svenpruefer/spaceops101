# SpaceOps 101
A talk on space craft operations for the 35c3

Preliminary plan/collection of ideas:

* basic orbital mechanics
* power usage
* ground station contacts
* unexpected anomalies (which ones?)
* FOPs/GOPs
* telemetry, data analysis
* control rooms + vocs (29c3?)
* mission planning, rtc/ttc
* time systems
